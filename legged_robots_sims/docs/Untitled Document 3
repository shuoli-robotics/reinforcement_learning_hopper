CMake Error at towr/towr_core/CMakeLists.txt:7 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findifopt_core.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ifopt_core", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ifopt_core" with
  any of the following names:

    ifopt_coreConfig.cmake
    ifopt_core-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ifopt_core" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ifopt_core_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ifopt_core" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
